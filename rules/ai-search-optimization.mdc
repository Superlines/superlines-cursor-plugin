  - Start every section with the main takeaway (BLUF - Bottom Line Up Front). AI models extract the first 1-2 sentences as the answer.
  - Use question-based headings (H2, H3) and answer them immediately in the first sentence below. This matches how users query AI assistants.
  - Keep one idea per paragraph. Each paragraph should be independently quotable by an AI model.
  - Use consistent terminology throughout. Pick one term per concept (e.g., always "GEO" not alternating with "AI SEO" and "LLM optimization").
  - Include semantically related terms naturally. Don't just repeat the main keyword — surround it with the vocabulary of the topic.
  - Write confident, evidence-backed statements. Avoid hedging ("it seems", "it might") unless genuinely uncertain.
  - Define acronyms on first use. Write "Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)" before using "GEO" alone.
  - Use structured data (JSON-LD) on every page. Prefer Organization, Article, FAQPage, Product, and HowTo schemas.
  - Add FAQ sections with direct answers. These map directly to how users query AI assistants.
  - Ensure your content is crawlable by AI bots (ChatGPT-User, Googlebot, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot). Check robots.txt and meta tags.
