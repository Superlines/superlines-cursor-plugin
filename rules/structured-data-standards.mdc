structured-data-standards:
  - Always use JSON-LD format for structured data. Place it in a <script type="application/ld+json"> tag in the <head>.
  - Every page must have at minimum an Organization or WebSite schema at the site level.
  - Article pages need Article or BlogPosting schema with headline, author, datePublished, dateModified, and publisher.
  - Product pages need Product schema with name, description, offers (price, currency, availability), and aggregateRating when available.
  - FAQ pages need FAQPage schema with Question and acceptedAnswer pairs.
  - HowTo content needs HowTo schema with step-by-step instructions.
  - Always include the @context "https://schema.org" and validate with Google's Rich Results Test.
  - Keep schema data consistent with visible page content. Never include data in schema that isn't on the page.
  - Use sameAs property to link to official social profiles and authoritative sources.
  - Nest schemas when appropriate (e.g., author inside Article, offers inside Product).
