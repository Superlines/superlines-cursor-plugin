ai-friendly-writing:
  - Don't bury the point. Start with the main takeaway, then explain it.
  - If a heading is a question, the first sentence must contain a direct answer.
  - Keep sentences short with clear subject and verb. Avoid long chains of dependent clauses.
  - State the point literally before adding personality or metaphors.
  - Every pronoun ("it", "this", "that") must have an obvious referent in the same or previous sentence.
  - One topic per paragraph. If introducing a new claim, start a new paragraph.
  - Use clear heading hierarchy: H2 for core sections, H3 for subpoints.
  - Keep terminology consistent. One term per concept throughout the document.
  - Write confident, evidence-backed statements. Avoid constant hedging.
  - Use semantically related terms naturally alongside the main keyword.
  - Define acronyms and technical terms on first use.
  - Make every paragraph quotable on its own — it should make sense even if extracted in isolation.
